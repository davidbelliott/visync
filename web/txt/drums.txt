Once, jungles blanketed the earth, and people flourished in greater numbers. Game abounded and hunger was unknown.
There was a tribe who spoke through drums. Their beats carried through the air, conveying messages between settlements scattered across the cloud forest.
Their most guarded wisdom was the crafting of shape-shifting drums. These instruments, when perfectly formed and struck with precise rhythms, allowed one to take on an animal form. During transformation, the human essence remained inside the drum while awareness inhabited the beast.
Only drum elders controlled this knowledge, permitting transformations solely during sacred ceremonies and healing rituals.
Takal, the most skilled drum apprentice, yearned for these secrets. After observing forbidden ceremonies from shadows, he assembled knowledge to craft a flawless drum—one permitting transformation at will.
During a moonless night, Takal cut wood from the Ceiba tree and skin from a jaguar he killed in secret. He bound them with forest-strangler fibers and painted the rim with pigments mixed in his own blood.
Upon completion, he struck it once. The sound pierced the forest unlike any drum before—clear as spring water, deep as earth's breath. With this tone, shape-shifting became effortless.
Takal shared his knowledge. Soon, many villagers crafted their own instruments and spent days as animals.
With one type of rhythm, one could soar as an eagle…
With another, slither through the dense leaves as a snake…
Swing through branches as a spider-monkey…
Or prowl the forest floor as a jaguar.
The experience surpassed all others. To feel jaguar-strength, know bird-freedom, possess serpent-wisdom—these sensations eclipsed human pleasures.
Day by day, fewer remained in human form. Garden plots withered. Hearths cooled. Infants wailed unfed while parents watched from treetops or prowled below.
Nayo, the mountain-dweller far above the settlement, watched human existence fade. Once a gifted drum-maker, he had long since given up the craft to live in solitude.
Trekking to the village, he confronted Takal, who alone returned to human shape nightly to craft more perfect drums.
"Our people forget themselves," Nayo warned. "Soon none will tend sacred flames or remember ancient stories."
Takal laughed. "They are unbound now. Why remain human when one can know all forms?"
"The drums must be destroyed," Nayo declared, reaching for Takal's newest creation.
Takal's eyes flashed. No-one would destroy his achievement. Seizing his most powerful drum, he struck a violent rhythm.
"You interfere? Become the lowest creature," Takal hissed. "Become what devours dead things in darkness."
The sound vibrated through Nayo. His flesh rippled then collapsed into a crowd of small termites.
Satisfied, Takal placed Nayo's drum in his collection and resumed work, blind to any consequences.
The termites moved purposefully. They spread throughout the settlement, entering each drum through the base. From within, they consumed the Ceiba wood.
One by one, drums collapsed, weakened by the insects' relentless feeding. As each broke, a human essence freed, and somewhere in forest depths, a startled villager returned to human form.
Takal was suddenly awakened from animal form. He rushed to his collection—too late. All were ruined except one: Nayo's drum.
In a rage, Takal sealed Nayo’s drum inside a hollowed stone and sunk it in the deepest part of the sacred cenote, where it could be destroyed by neither man, animal, nor fire. "Now you will never return to human form," he cursed Nayo.
From that day onward, Nayo never was seen again. But whenever a drum approached perfection, termites emerged to eat holes into the instrument and change its tone.
This explains why people are fewer now, for many were lost before Nayo's sacrifice. Why no drum achieves perfection. And why, in villages keeping ancient ways, the tunnels in wood are read as messages—for in these patterns lies Nayo’s wisdom, who, though transformed against his will, preserved humanity through his curse.
